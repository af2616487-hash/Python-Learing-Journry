# Variables and Data Types in Python

## Overview
Variables are containers for storing data values. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Different data types include integers, floats, strings, booleans, and more.

## 1. Variable Case Sensitivity

**Concept:** Variables in Python are case-sensitive. `x` and `X` are different variables.

```python
# CODE BLOCK 1 - Add your code here:

```

---

## 2. String Concatenation

**Concept:** Combining strings using the concatenation operator `+`.

```python
# CODE BLOCK 2 - Add your code here:

```

---

## 3. String Data Type

**Concept:** Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. The `str()` function converts values to strings.

```python
# CODE BLOCK 3 - Add your code here:

```

---

## 4. Float Arithmetic Operations

**Concept:** Floating-point numbers support arithmetic operations like multiplication, division, etc.

```python
# CODE BLOCK 4 - Add your code here:

```

---

## 5. Temperature Conversion

**Concept:** Converting temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: (C × 9/5) + 32

```python
# CODE BLOCK 5 - Add your code here:

```

---

## 6. Mixed Data Type Operations

**Concept:** Python allows operations between different numeric types (int + float). The result is automatically converted to float.

```python
# CODE BLOCK 6 - Add your code here:

```

---

## 7. Data Type Classification

**Concept:** Detecting and classifying input data types - Boolean, Integer, Float, or String.

```python
# CODE BLOCK 7 - Add your code here:

```

---

## 8. File Path Construction

**Concept:** Building dynamic file paths by combining multiple variables. Paths can use forward slashes (Linux) or backslashes (Windows).

```python
# CODE BLOCK 8 - Add your code here:

```

## Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Variables** | Named containers that store values |
| **Case Sensitivity** | `x` and `X` are different variables |
| **String Concatenation** | Joining strings with `+` operator |
| **Type Conversion** | Converting between int(), float(), str() |
| **Arithmetic Operations** | +, -, *, /, //, **, % |
| **Data Types** | int, float, str, bool, list, dict, tuple |

---

## Quick Reference

- **Integer:** `x = 10`
- **Float:** `x = 10.5`
- **String:** `x = "Hello"`
- **Boolean:** `x = True`
- **Type Checking:** `type(x)` returns the data type
